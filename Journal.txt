Turtle Crossing

In the beginning, we were given 4 files as a starter (car_manager, main, player, and scoreboard).
In those file there are some variable that determine things like how fast the car and player move, how fast the car after finished 1 level, etc.
So the first thing i want to make is the player class, since its the most straight forward.

1. Player can only move forward at a specified speed.
2. Player have a Turtle shape
3. Player start at STARTING_POSITION (0,-280) every round.

then , after that we can work on scoreboard

1. Make a level text
2. Make an update or a refresh function if the turtle pass the level

then, we can start work at the car class, also make change in the previous class that we build before (if needed).
so, what we need the car do is

1. Generate
2. Move from right to left at a specified speed
3. Have a rectangle shape.
4. Have a different random color each.
5. Speed increase as the level increase.

So for the Generate, i was loking at the snake project on how to generate the segment of the snake. Then with that i figure we can take that code
to generate the car as well!!
we can also take the logic to move the snake, tweak it a bit. then it can move. The random color is quite easy to make, just use the random modul.

Then we Assemble all of the class in main.py
it contains

1. Collision Detector
2. Finish Detection
3. Game Over
4. Generation delay

so, in main.py it went smoothly until the Generation delay part. I had to google it and use Chat GPT.


Overall i'm pretty impressed with my work today. I finish the project with the Expert difficulty (only look at the first step).
